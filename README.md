# Bikeshare project for Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python
Created on May 21, 2020

## What's this repository about?
The purpose is to showcase the final Python project of this Nanodegree that focuses mostly on Pythons's libraries that are frequently used in the data science domain (here it's especially Pandas).

Except Pandas I also used the Streamlit framework for data visualization.

### TODOs:

* Add more info about Streamlit and how to run the app
* Describe files used
* Add links to 3rd party resources
