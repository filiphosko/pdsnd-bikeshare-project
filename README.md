# Bikeshare project for Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python
Created on May 21, 2020

## What's this repository about?
The purpose is to showcase the final Python project of this Nanodegree that focuses mostly on Pythons's libraries that are frequently used in the data science domain (here it's especially Pandas).

Except Pandas I also used the Streamlit framework for data visualization https://www.streamlit.io/. With it I was able to put together a basic Python app with charts and filtering based on select boxes - from the UX standpoint I liked it much more than just having the user to interact with the shell environment ðŸ˜‰

### TODOs:

* Describe files used
* Add links to 3rd party resources
